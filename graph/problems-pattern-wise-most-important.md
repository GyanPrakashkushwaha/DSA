Of course! Here is a list of LeetCode problems, categorized by the four common graph representation patterns you identified.

***

### 1. Edge List Problems ‚ÜîÔ∏è

In these problems, the graph is given as a list of edges, like `edges = [[u, v], ...]`. Your first step is almost always to convert this into an **adjacency list** to perform traversals efficiently.

* [**1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph**](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/) (Easy): A perfect introductory problem. You're given edges and must determine if a path exists between two nodes.
* [**684. Redundant Connection**](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/) (Medium): You're given a set of edges that form a tree with one extra edge. Your task is to find that redundant edge. (Often solved with Union-Find).
* [**323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph**](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/) (Medium - Premium): The classic problem of counting disconnected groups of nodes. You build the graph and then run DFS or BFS from each node to count the components.
* [**261. Graph Valid Tree**](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/) (Medium - Premium): Given edges, you must verify if they form a valid tree structure (i.e., it's fully connected and has no cycles).

### 2. Adjacency List Problems üó∫Ô∏è

These problems either provide the graph directly as an adjacency list or use a structure that functions as one (like a `Node` class with a `neighbors` list).

* [**797. All Paths From Source to Target**](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/) (Medium): The input is a literal adjacency list (`graph[i]` contains all nodes reachable from `i`). You need to find all possible paths from node `0` to `N-1`.
* [**133. Clone Graph**](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/) (Medium): A very common interview question. The input is a single node of a graph, where each node object has a value and a list of its neighbors. You must create a deep copy of the entire graph.
* [**207. Course Schedule**](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/) (Medium): The input `prerequisites` is technically an edge list, but the problem is a classic application of topological sorting on the adjacency list you build from it. You must determine if you can finish all courses.
* [**210. Course Schedule II**](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/) (Medium): A follow-up to the above, where you must return the order of courses if a valid schedule exists.

### 3. Grid (Implicit Graph) Problems üåê

These problems present a 2D grid where adjacency is determined by cell position (up, down, left, right). You calculate neighbors on the fly instead of building an explicit graph structure.

* [**200. Number of Islands**](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) (Medium): The most famous grid traversal problem. You count the number of disconnected groups of '1's in a grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water).
* [**994. Rotting Oranges**](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/) (Medium): A classic multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) problem. You must find the minimum time for all fresh oranges to become rotten.
* [**542. 01 Matrix**](https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/) (Medium): Given a grid of 0s and 1s, you need to find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell. This is another great multi-source BFS problem.
* [**1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix**](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/) (Medium): A standard BFS application to find the shortest path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of a grid.
* [**79. Word Search**](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/) (Medium): A Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking problem where you search for a word by traversing adjacent letters in a grid.

### 4. Adjacency Matrix Problems üî¢

In these problems, the graph is given as an `N x N` matrix, where `matrix[i][j] = 1` signifies a connection between node `i` and `j`.

* [**547. Number of Provinces**](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/) (Medium): The input `isConnected` is a textbook adjacency matrix. Your goal is to count the number of connected components (provinces).
* [**1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance**](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/) (Medium): While the input is an edge list with weights, the most common solution involves building an adjacency matrix and running the **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** to find all-pairs shortest paths, a classic use case for the matrix representation.
* [**277. Find the Celebrity**](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-celebrity/) (Medium - Premium): A tricky problem where you don't get the matrix directly but are given an API `knows(a, b)` which acts like accessing an adjacency matrix. The goal is to find the celebrity in an optimal way.
