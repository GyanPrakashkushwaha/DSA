Then onwards he entered into the business and started his own milk supply business. He started from supplying only 10-15 liters of milk, Tried to make new customers and built a network to suppliers from whom he buys, Did advertisements about his business so the people near his village who are located in the Satna city got to know about him. They knew he would give me good quality milk because he gave proof of his good quality milk by maintaining the quality of milk to his existing customers and now he is supplying 60-65 liters of milk everyday. \"\"\"\n",
