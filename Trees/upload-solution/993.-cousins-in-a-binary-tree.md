# Intuition
While adding the nodes to queue we know it's parents. So, we add the parent to queue while adding the child node to queue.

# Approach
- Add parent's value to queue with node as tuple.
- Increment the counter if find value equals to x or y and assign parents value of x's parent and y's parent.
- check if count equals 2(Count "2" denotes that we have found x and y at the same level.) and parents are not equal.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n)

- Space complexity:
O(n)

# Code
```python3 []
import collections
class Solution:
    def isCousins(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], x: int, y: int) -> bool:
        if not root: return False
        
        q = collections.deque([(root, None)])
        while q:
            size = len(q)
            c = 0
            xParent = None
            yParent = None
            for _ in range(size):
                node, parent = q.popleft()
                if node.val == x: 
                    c += 1
                    xParent = parent
                if node.val == y: 
                    c += 1
                    yParent = parent
                    
                if node.left: q.append((node.left, node.val))
                if node.right: q.append((node.right, node.val))

            if c == 2 and xParent != yParent: 
                return True
        
        return False
